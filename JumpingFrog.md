# Jumping Frog Game
### This is a simple and fun Jumping Frog Game created in Scratch. In this game, a frog on the left side of the screen jumps to avoid a moving stone that comes from the right side. The stone's vertical position changes randomly each time it appears, making the game challenging and unpredictable.

## How to Play:
- ### Start the game by clicking the green flag.
- ### Control the frog’s jumps using the space key to dodge the stone.
- ### Each time the stone appears, it moves across the screen with a new random position on the y-axis.
- ### Try to avoid getting hit for as long as possible to achieve a high score!
## Features:
### Randomized Stone Position: The stone’s y-axis value changes randomly, adding an element of surprise to each level.
### Simple Jump Mechanics: Just jump to dodge and stay safe!
## Instructions for Scratch:
### This project was created in Scratch and is a great example for beginners learning about movement, randomness, and collision detection.
